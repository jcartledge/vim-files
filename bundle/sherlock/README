sherlock.vim add completion from current buffer for command line mode ':' after a '/', and in command line mode '/' and '?'.

By default, it use <C-Tab> for forward completion, and <C-S-Tab> for backward completion.

For example:
:%s/tes<C-Tab> list all word which begin with 'tes' after current cursor position;
:%s/tes<C-S-Tab> list all word which begin with 'tes' before current cursor position;
/tes<C-Tab> list all word which begin with 'tes' after current cursor position;
/tes<C-S-Tab> list all word which begin with 'tes' before current cursor position;
?tes<C-Tab> list all word which begin with 'tes' after current cursor position;
?tes<C-S-Tab> list all word which begin with 'tes' before current cursor position;

In ':' mode, completion is available only after a '/'.

When the right string is in command line, you can:
1) Validate it with <Enter>, or type <Esc> to go away from command line if you are in '?' or '/' mode;
2) Validate it with <Enter> or '/', or type <Esc> to go away from command line if you are in ':' mode.

You can override the default mapping with something like that in your .vimrc:
cnoremap <Whatever you want here> <C-\>esherlock#completeBackward()<CR>
cnoremap <Whatever you want here> <C-\>esherlock#completeForward()<CR>

You can disable this plugin with this line in your .vimrc:
let sherlock#disable = 1
