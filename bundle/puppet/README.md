vim-puppet
==========

Installation
------------

If you're using pathogen to manage your vim modules (and if you're not, why 
aren't you), you can simply add this as a submodule in your `~/.vim/bundle/` 
directory.

My entire home directory is a git repository, so for me it's simply a case of

    $ git submodule add -f git://github.com/rodjek/vim-puppet.git .vim/bundle/puppet

If you're not using pathogen, you can just manually place the files in the
appropriate places under `~/.vim/`
